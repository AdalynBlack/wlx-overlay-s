# Tips for optimization:
# - try to re-use font sizes, every loaded font size uses additional VRAM.

# common properties:
# - rect: bounding rectangle [x, y, width, height]
#         (x, y) = (0, 0) is top-left
# - bg_color: background color of panels and buttons
# - fg_color: color of text
#
# element types:
# panel - simple colored rectangle
#   rect: bounding rectangle
#   bg_color: color of rectangle. quotation marks mandatory.
#
# clock - date/time display with custom formatting
#   rect: bounding rectangle
#   fg_color: color of text. quotation marks mandatory.
#   format: chrono format to print, see https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html

    ### MirrorButton
    # Bring an additional PipeWire screen, window, region or virtual screen share into VR.
    # These are view-only, and will not respond to pointers by moving your mouse.
    # You may have as many as you like, but the `name` must be unique for each.
    # Controls:
    # - Blue Click: Show/hide. Shows pipewire prompt on first show.
    # - Orange Click: Toggle lock in place
    # - Purple Click: Stop capture. After doing this, you may Blue-click again to select a different source.
    # - Scroll: Adjust opacity
    # Warning:
    # - Window shares may stop updating if the window goes off-screen or is on an inactive workspace
    # - Resizing, minimizing, maximizing windows may break stuff. Complain to your xdg-desktop-portal implementation.
    # - Selections are not saved across sessions
